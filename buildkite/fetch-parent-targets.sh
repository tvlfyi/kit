# Each Buildkite build stores the derivation target map as a pipeline
# artifact. This script determines the most appropriate commit (the
# fork point of the current chain from HEAD) and fetches the artifact.
#
# New builds can be based on HEAD before the pipeline for the last
# commit has finished, in which case it is possible that the fork
# point has no derivation map. To account for this, up to 3 commits
# prior to HEAD are also queried to find a map.
#
# If no map is found, the failure mode is not critical: We simply
# build all targets.
