# Provides a function to automatically read a a filesystem structure
# into a Nix attribute set.
#
# Called with an attribute set taking the following arguments:
#
#   path: Path to a directory from which to start reading the tree.
#
#   args: Argument set to pass to each imported file.
#
#   filter: Function to filter `args` based on the tree location. This should
#           be a function of the form `args -> location -> args`, where the
#           location is a list of strings representing the path components of
#           the current readTree target. Optional.
